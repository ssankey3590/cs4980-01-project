(* First, let's define our basic geometric objects *)
locale triangle_configuration =
  fixes A B C :: complex    (* Points as complex numbers *)
  fixes S E D L P :: complex
  assumes acute: "is_acute_triangle A B C"
  and AB_less_AC: "dist A B < dist A C"
  and omega_circle: "on_circle B D L"    (* Points B,D,L lie on circle \<omega> *)
  and Omega_circle: "on_circle A B C"    (* Points A,B,C lie on circle \<Omega> *)
  and S_midpoint: "S = midpoint_arc C B A"
  and D_perpendicular: "is_perpendicular (vector A D) (vector B C)"
  and E_on_AD: "collinear A D E"
  and E_on_Omega: "on_circle A B C E"
  and L_parallel: "is_parallel (vector D L) (vector B C)"
  and L_on_BE: "collinear B E L"
  and P_intersection: "P \<noteq> B \<and> on_circle B D L P \<and> on_circle A B C P"

(* Now let's state our main theorem *)
theorem tangent_meets_bisector:
  assumes config: "triangle_configuration A B C S E D L P"
  shows "let t = tangent_line \<omega> P;
         b = angle_bisector B A C
         in intersect t (line B S) \<in> b"
  sorry
(* We'll break this into lemmas *)

lemma power_of_point:
  assumes "triangle_configuration A B C S E D L P"
  shows "power_of_point P \<omega> = power_of_point P \<Omega>"
  sorry

lemma angle_properties:
  assumes "triangle_configuration A B C S E D L P"
  shows "angle B P S = angle B A C / 2"

(* Main proof *)
proof -
  (* The proof would involve several steps:
     1. Use power of point theorem for P with respect to both circles
     2. Utilize the parallel property of DL to BC
     3. Apply angle relationships in cyclic quadrilaterals
     4. Use properties of angle bisectors
     5. Combine these to show the tangent line meets BS on the angle bisector
