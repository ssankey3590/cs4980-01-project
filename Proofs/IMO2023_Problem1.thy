(* First, we need to define points in the plane using complex numbers *)
type_synonym point = complex

(* We'll need some helper functions for geometric concepts *)
definition distance :: "point \<Rightarrow> point \<Rightarrow> real"
  where "distance p q = norm (p - q)"

(* Define what it means for points to be on a circle *)
definition on_circle :: "point \<Rightarrow> point \<Rightarrow> real \<Rightarrow> bool"
  where "on_circle center p r \<equiv> (distance center p = r)"

(* Main theorem statement *)
theorem imo2023_p1:
  fixes A B C D E P :: point
  assumes "D \<in> line B C"    (* D lies on BC *)
    and "E \<in> line C A"      (* E lies on CA *)
    and "P \<in> line A D"      (* P lies on AD *)
    and "P \<in> line B E"      (* P lies on BE *)
    and "P \<in> circle A D E"  (* P lies on circle through A,D,E *)
  shows "norm(A - P) * norm(B - P) = norm(C - P)^2"
